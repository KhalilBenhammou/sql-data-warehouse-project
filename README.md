**1. Bronze Layer:** Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.

**2. Silver Layer:** This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.

**3. Gold Layer:** Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.
